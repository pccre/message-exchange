Chat server reimplementation for PC Creator 2

![Screenshot of a PC Creator 2 mod connected to an instance of this server](misc/example.jpg)

# Public Instances
There are currently no publicly available instances to use. If you run an instance and want to be featured here, open a pull request or an issue.

# Improvements
- Strict content structure checking
- Greeting message

# Compatibility
The server does not behave 1 to 1 with the game one. However, the behaviour is pretty similar, so this works with the game.

# Building
You must have the [Go programming language](https://go.dev) installed
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `build.sh` script
3. If prompted, install any needed dependencies and run the script again

It will output a binary named `main` that is the server
